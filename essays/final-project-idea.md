## Overview

UH Manoa has a thriving community of students and staff that want to hosts events for fundrasising, raising awareness, and more. Sadly, there is no central location to advertise events other than campus bulletin boards. These often go unnoticed by students as they can be messy, unorganized, and unregulated. Our solution is to introduce a web application that allows event organizers from UH to promote their events in a simple and appealing manner. In addition, there could be a comments section for students to ask questions to event organizers.


## Mockup Page Ideas

Some mockup pages include:
<ul class="ui list">
  <li class="item">Home Page</li>
  <li class="item">Login Page</li>
  <li class="item">Events Calendar Page</li>
  <li class="item">Admin Page</li>
  <li class="item">Browse Events by Category</li>
</ul>


## Use Case Ideas

The pages should implement the following functions:

<ul class="ui list">
  <li class="item">A public user visits the homepage, immediately view upcoming events, visit events calendar page, and browse events by category.</li>
  <li class="item">An admin user can visit the login page, create and manage events.</li>
  <li class="item">Logged in users are able to comment/question on events and create events in addition to what a public user can do.</li>
</ul>


## Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basics there are some additional functionalities we would like to add:
A system checks to see if events have the required information and notifys an admin for approval.
A system to let users express their interest in attending.
