## Overview

UH Manoa has a thriving community of students and staff that want to hosts events for fundrasising, raising awareness, and more. Sadly, there is no central location to advertise events other than campus bulletin boards. These often go unnoticed by students as they can be messy, unorganized, and unregulated. Our solution is to introduce a web application that allows event organizers from UH to promote their events in a simple and appealing manner. In addition, there could be a comments section for students to ask questions to event organizers.


## Mockup Page Ideas

Some mockup pages include:
<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="item">Home Page</div>
  <div class="item">Login Page</div>
  <div class="item">Events Calendar Page</div>
  <div class="item">Admin Page</div>
  <div class="item">Browse Events by Category</div>
</div>


## Use Case Ideas

The pages should implement the following functions:

<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="item">A public user visits the homepage, immediately view upcoming events, visit events calendar page, and browse events by category.</div>
  <div class="item">An admin user can visit the login page, create and manage events.</div>
  <div class="item">Logged in users are able to comment/question on events and create events in addition to what a public user can do.</div>
</div>

## Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basics there are some additional functionalities we would like to add:

<div class="ui bulleted list">
  <div class="item">A system checks to see if events have the required information and notifys an admin for approval.</div>
  <div class="item">A system to let users express their interest in attending.</div>
</div>
