## Making a Star

With over a billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, it is hard to imagine the amount of space needed to house them all. Even if we had the technology to make a star where would we put it? What purpose would it serve? What materials do we need to make a star? So many questions for a thing that provides light and other essential services for our planet. Similarily, these were the types of questions I was asking when developing the digits application in Meteor.

## Meteor Shower of Questions

Meteor was my first experience in developing a client-server application. With this in mind, the question I asked myself, how do you develop a website? My experience with client-server applications come from websites and video games. There, you hardly recognize the cohesion between client and server until something goes wrong. Even with the Meteor application template and Meteor example form code I found it difficult to keep track of what code to keep on the client, server, or both.

Another question I asked, how do you verify that form inputs match certain qualifications? This is something expected out of all web forms that ask for user input such as name, address, password, and more. Our digits application used SimpleSchema, a validation package for Meteor. By creating a SimpleSchema instance for our collection documents, we were able to validate the form data before we updated the database. In essence, even simple functionality can require a separate Meteor package.

## The End?

Having two weeks to develop the digits application made me appreciate software engineering and Meteor. As a software engineer, it takes great skill in your thinking and proficiency in your tools to create applications. Whether you are making a website to advertise your business or making the next great installment to the Angry Birds franchise, the same fundamentals are required. I feel that Meteor has allowed me to visualize how to create the applications that I have always wanted. Though the digits application is over, there are still many more stars to create.
