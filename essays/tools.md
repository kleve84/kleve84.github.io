## Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X & Ctrl+V

The ability to cut, copy, and paste text on a computer has simplified software development. Instead of learning how to make a fancy menu for your webpage you can cut, copy, and paste another person's implementation. These shortcuts pose great benefits and risks for upcoming software engineers. Chiefly, the ability to accelerate development without having to learn the ins and outs. I believe that some tools take too long to learn and can make one feel that the shortcut is the better option. Luckily, instead of cutting, copying, and pasting entire websites I was introduced to a new tool for web development called Semantic UI.

## Tools of the Trade

Between the two tools above, which one would you prefer? Obviously, the multi-tool as it has the most features required to do any job while the scissors can only do one. With this in mind, what if I now told you that you had to cut out 500 paper airplanes, which tool would you choose? Obviously, the scissors as it has all the functionality needed for the job. UI Frameworks are just that, another tool used for developing user interfaces. Each tool has its benefits and disadvantages. If you need to create a one-of-a-kind website for Facebook then Semantic UI may not be the best tool. It is up to the software engineer to decide what time and place to use a tool.

## Semantic UI

Having the week to develop and test website interfaces using Semantic UI has made me appreciate UI Frameworks. A lot of thought and testing goes into designing a website through traditional HTML and CSS. Semantic UI allowed me to develop an acceptable site in just a fraction of the time. However, there were issues with Semantic UI such as being unable to customize dropdown menus and the learning curve. Still, I would deveop using Semantic UI again as it is much faster than developing from scratch. As an aspiring engineer it is important to be flexible in the tools you use to solve a problem. Twitter Bootstrap, Semantic UI, HTML, CSS, or HTML5 are all tools used in structuring and presenting conent on the Internet. It is up to an individual which path they want to take.
