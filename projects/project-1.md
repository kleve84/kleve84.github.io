summary: I was assigned to a team in my Software Engineering class to develop a Meteor application. We decided to create a recipe application to be used by Manoa students and the public.

The Manoa Recipes project was created to serve the university community as a place for students and others to share food recipes. As many people know, living in Hawaii is expensive due to living in paradise. The project aimed to allow students to share cheap food recipes that could be prepared with local ingredients and with limited cooking tools. 

I was part of a four student team responsible for implementing the Manoa Recipes application. I created the recipe directory which allowed users to easily browse all recipes stored on the website. I decided on a card layout as it was similar to professional recipe websites, such as <a href="http://allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes.com.</a> In addition, I created the recipe view page which displayed a short description of the recipe and how to make it. This required pulling the right values from the Mongo database and use of semantic UI to make the page presentable. It was enjoyable to work in a team and I was able to get my first taste of software engineering.

Altogether, I learned a lot about software engineering from this project. One of the most important experiences was working with a team using Github. It was my first time using a code management tool and it drastically improved the effectiveness of teamwork. It became easy to push our own contributions to the code but to also help each other if someone got stuck. In addition, I got to gain experience with the Meteor web framework and got to create working web pages in a short amount of time. This experience shaped my career and was a stepping stone into the professional world.
